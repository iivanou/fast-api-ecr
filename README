Yeah, we can obviously use AWS serverless framework to create a serverless rest API.
However, the message was to not follow the easiest way. So, we are here in that document.

This app is assumed to be deployed to the following AWS environment:
(Cognito if it is necessary) + API Gateway + Lambda with ECR deployment type + DynamoDB database + CloudWatch

Manual high-level action items that were performed are below:
1. Create DynamoDB table with the product-employees table
2. Create ECR repository where Lambda image will be stored
3. Build Docker container from the project sources
4. Upload created Docker container to the ECR repository
5. Add IAM role that gives Lambda full(I know...) access to DynamoDB and CouldWatch services
6. Create Lambda function based on the uploaded Docker image
7. Add new proxy API Gateway deployment targeting to the created Lambda function
8. Optional. Add Cognito authorizer to the API Gateway deployment
